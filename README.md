## Project Insights
- The highest sales in October suggest that the business experiences a peak in demand during this month, possibly due to seasonal trends, promotions, or holiday shopping. It is essential to analyse the factors driving this peak to replicate the success in other months.
- Europe accounts for the highest sales with 25% of total sales. This indicates that the European market is a key driver of revenue, and focusing marketing and sales strategies in this region could help the 
business continue to leverage this strength.
-Consumers are the highest-performing customer segment, indicating that the business has a strong customer base within this group. Targeting consumer needs, preferences, and behaviours can further enhance sales in this segment.
- The USA ranks as the highest-selling country in the top 10, highlighting its importance as a major revenue-generating market. Tailoring offers, product availability, and marketing efforts specifically for the U.S. market could further boost sales in this region.
- Cardio Equipment leads the top 5 product categories, suggesting that this category is in high demand and is a significant revenue driver. Expanding the range of products in this category or enhancing its marketing could further capitalize on its popularity.
- Toys rank as the lowest category, indicating underperformance in this segment. This may suggest a need to revaluate product offerings, pricing, or promotional strategies within the toys category to boost sales.
## Final Conclusion
To improve Ecommerce sales, maximise profitability, focus on expanding high-demand categories like cardio equipment and optimizing marketing strategies in regions such as Europe and the USA. The underperformance in the toys category suggests the need for a review of product offerings, pricing strategies, and targeted promotions to boost sales in this segment. Finally, leveraging insights from peak sales months like October can help replicate success throughout the year by timing promotions and inventory management effectively.
